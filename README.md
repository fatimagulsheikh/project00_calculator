Simple Command Line Calculator
Develop a simple command line calculator using TypeScipt, Node.js and Inquirer.

Create a GitHub repository for the project and submit its URL and NPX command in the project submission form. Please note that you will create a NPX command for your project and publish it on npm. After the NPX command is working you will announce it on Panaverse groups on Facebook, Discord, and Twitter.

You can develop CLI Games using Inquirer, Chalk, etc. All your class projects will be CLI based and should be deployed as an NPX command
